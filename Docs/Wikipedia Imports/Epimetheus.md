[Epimetheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus): In Greek mythology, Epimetheus (; Greek: Ἐπιμηθεύς, lit. "afterthought") is the twin brother of Prometheus, the pair serving "as representatives of mankind". Both sons of the Titan Iapetus, while Prometheus ("foresight") is ingeniously clever, Epimetheus ("hindsight") is inept and foolish. In some accounts of the myth, Epimetheus unleashes the unforeseen troubles in Pandora's box.

[Hecatoncheires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatoncheires): In Greek mythology, the Hecatoncheires (Greek: Ἑκατόγχειρες, translit. Hekatóncheires, lit. "Hundred-Handed Ones"), also called Hundred-Handers or Centimanes (; Latin: Centimani), were three monstrous giants, of enormous size and strength, each with fifty heads and one hundred arms. They were individually named Cottus (the furious), Briareus (or Aegaeon, the sea goat) and Gyges (or Gyes, the long-limbed). In the standard tradition, they were the offspring of Uranus (Sky) and of Gaia (Earth), and helped Zeus and the Olympians to overthrow the Titans in the Titanomachy.

[[Hydrogen bond]]ing
	![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg)
	the partially positive of one hydrogen molecule is attracted to the partially negative oxygen of another
	each bond only lasts a trilianth of a second 
	waters properties come from hydrogen bonding and polarity
	**cohesion**
		hydrogen bonds hold water molicules together
	**adhesion**
		is hydrogen bonds making water cling to other things (not water things)
	
water has a high specific heat making it absorb heat and evaporate it back out reducing overall heat in air and land touching a large enough body of water such as the coast of califorina being much cooler than the inland areas because of the ocean

ice floats because hydrogen bonds become stronger and make a large less dense crystal strucre making it float allowing for life

water in all forms are highly inportant and climate change is disrupting that 
	polarbears - want more ice because thats how they hunt 
	bow head wales are triving due to the incresed phyto plankton in the ocean due to less ice
hydrophobic
	a molicule that has opposing polarity to water making it reppel
Hydrophilic 
	a molicule that matches the polarity of water making it attract
acids and bases are caused by the amound of free hydrogen ions in a molicule wate has 2 therfor has a ph of 7 or roughly equal
hydronim has 3 an is more acidic hydroxide has one and is more basic

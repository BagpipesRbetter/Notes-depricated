	Q:
		why is [[Carbon]] considered the building block of life|what about its structer makes it good for life
	A: 
		All Life that originated on earth started with [[Carbon]],
		and [[Carbon]] has a lot of open slots so it can bond to alot of stuff in different ways 
Agenda
	Finish Bonding Notes
	Begin Water Notes
	Start Water Lab

***Element is the smallest form of matter and has unique properties, 
A Compound is a substance that has more than one element***

Example of structure: Silicon 
	protons: 14 
		also the atomic number(linked to the identity of the element), positive charge, nucleus, mass = 1
	neutrons: 14
		found from atomic mass - the protons,
	electrons: 14
		electrons and protons have opposite charge and auto balence to equal amounts
	valence electrons: 4
		comes from the amount of extra electrons after filling the first two rings, also is on the table (outside of D-block)		![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCTAQaubQ4o/sddefault.jpg)
	atomic mass: 28
		Protons + Neutrons + a little bit of electron mass

***Ion is when the electron doesnâ€™t match the protons causing the imbalance of charge***

isotopes: occasionally used as medicine or radiotherapy

~~elements bond if they collide and electron availability is liked?~~
A balanced atom has balanced electrons and protons and also has a balanced valence ring these don't match when another atom bonds if fills each others most sable form (***octet rule***) or achieve full set of electrons 

[[Ionic Bonding]]
	Goal: 2 or 8
	non concurrent with covalent
	2 elements or molicules, 1 gives 1 takes electrons = ballence and attraction
	
[[Covalent Bond]]ing
	shared not traded electrons

atomic radius increases from right to left and top to bottom on the table

**Electro Negativity**
	opposite of atomic radius on the table

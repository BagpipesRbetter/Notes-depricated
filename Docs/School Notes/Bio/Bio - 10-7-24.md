Organic v inorganic molecules
	O=Comes from biological processes 
	I=Has No Origin In Life

Macro molecules 
	![](https://wou.edu/chemistry/files/2017/01/building-blocks-and-macromolecules.png)
	[[monomer]] + [[monomer]] = [[polymer]]
	4 macros i need to know
		[[carbohydrate]]s
		[[protein]]s
		[[Nucleic acid]]s
		[[lipid]]s
	dehydration synthesis
		lose water to build [[molecule]]
		water loss causes monomer [[Covalent bond]]
	hydrolysis
		add water break [[molecule]]
		water breaks covalent of monomer 
	Activity: sort the molecules	![[IMG_1635.jpg]]

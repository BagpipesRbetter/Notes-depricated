Starter
	difernce between ionic and covalent bonds
		one is shared electrons(covalent) one is give and take(ionic)

******

The Formation and function of a molicule is determined by shape and makeup

change in shape = change in Function 

**Bonds Determine Shape
	Shape Determines Function**

***[[Ionic bonding]]*** is giving an electron and sticking to eachothe due to the ***opposite charges***

***[[Covalent Bond]]*** is sharing an electron 

Polar and Non Polar
	NonPolar
	Equal Sharing Of electrons = non polar, stable
		non polar is attracted to other non polar and dissolves non polar 
		Hydrophobic
	Polar
	Unequal sharing of electrons
		attracted to polar and dissolves in polar 
		water and salt
		Hydrophilic 
	Polar + non polar cant dissolve
Covalent = Equal sharing
polar covalent = unequal sharing

water is polar covalent

[[Hydrogen Bond]]s
	hapens in water and protein 
	very weak but substantial 
	very inportant bio wise
	attracted to O or N
	due to diffrences in electro negativity 
	2 Diffrent Molicules Of watter or other 
	*NOT SAME USE AS COVALENT OR IONIC*

The more Hydrogen ions the more acidic
soap is polar on one and non on the other

***Properties Of Water***
	Cohesion
		sticks to itself through hydrogen bonding
		Source of surface tension 
		**Surfactants** break surface tension by breaking hydrogen bonds
	Adhesion
		sticks to other things through Hydrogen bonding and polarity

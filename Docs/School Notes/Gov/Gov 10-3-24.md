	[[Federalist No. 78]]
		written by Alexander Hamilton, discusses the 
		importance of an independent judiciary in the newly formed United States government. Hamilton argues that the Constitution's provision for judicial review, which gives the Supreme Court the power to declare laws and actions taken by other branches unconstitutional, is essential to maintaining the balance of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. He notes that while the legislature has the power to make laws, and the executive has the power to enforce them, it is the judiciary's role to ensure that these powers are exercised within the bounds of the Constitution. Hamilton also emphasizes the need for a robust and independent judiciary to protect individual rights and liberties from government abuse, arguing that an impartial and supreme court can provide a check on the other branches' power and maintain the rule of law in the country.

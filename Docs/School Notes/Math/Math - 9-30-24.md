At home test 3 Had a Problem Go look at it again
4.3 is today
	vertex form
		$$f(x)=a(x-h)^2 +k$$
		vertx for this would be (h,k)
		$$f(x)=3(x+2)^2 -4$$
		vertex for this would be (-2,-4)
		**h lies and the polarity is fliped**
distribute binomial
	$$(a+b)^2$$
	$$(a+b)(a+b)$$
***overall lesson is completing the square***
	$$a^2 +2ab+b^2$$

## Ratings and Reviews

### A must have app!

> (Updating the review as I wrote my orginal review years ago) This is still a must have app. It is indispensable for average/casual users and apple nerds alike. I also highly recommend downloading Ian’s iOS apps. Great to have access to this very accurate information on all your devices. Download here now and then go download on iOS. You won’t regret it.  
> Even if you’re a casual user (i.e. not a tech geek) you should download this app. You will find it immensely helpful (especially in times of need like repairs, resale, getting replacement parts, etc.) for identifying your exact computer or idevice. For the Apple/Mac afficiando or collector, it is an invaluable tool. It’s also fun to just take a trip down memory lane through all the many, many years of Apple products. How many products have you owned? Do you remember your first Apple II from back in the 70’s? Ian Page has done an excellent job with this app. Thank you Ian!

### My Goto Reference

> I'm an IT Professional and this is my goto reference app, especially for legacy equipment. Some of the key features are being able to lookup RAM on the fly, what OS X or iOS a system was shipped with, the latest iOS or OS X a device can run, as well as the all important Apple classification of "Supported, Vintage or Obsolete" Thanks so much for including build and model numbers with all of the various generations of product lines.
> 
> It's worth installing just to take a trip down memory lane with a history lesson regarding such groundbreaking innovations as the 10th Anniversary Macintosh, The "Cube" i.e. The Power Mac G4 Cube, and especially the xserve line which I'm still heartbroken over losing.
> 
> One last thing. Get in touch with the developers of MActracker if you find this program usefull! I did.

### Great reference app

> This is a great reference application when it comes to Apple products (especially hardware). Now sure, something like this can easily be thrown into a web interface, but having a quick, and lightweight app to pull this kind of information is really nice. The smart categories in particular can really help speed up your search; for example, you can create a category for Macs with Coffee Lake CPUs, or all Mac models that are currently supported. Of course, you can get way more specific with category criteria, but I think the point has been made. Occasionally, there can be delays when it comes to the addition of new products, but this isn’t really a significant issue (if one at all).

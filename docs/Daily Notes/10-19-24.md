Alright so today was pretty chill, I woke up at around 9:30ish and then relaxed watched yt and insta for a bit before playing some [[The Legend of Zelda~ Echoes of Wisdom]] I’m in the boss battle of the third rift against echo Gannon, *HE HAS SOOO MANY STAGES* 

I also have work today, 5:30-close we’ll see how it goes,

I also woke up to mt timp covered in snow ❄️ which was a pleasant surprise
